			<h2 id="box1">Black Tea</h2>
			<p>Something interesting about black tea. Includes Earl Grey (black tea blend with bergamot) and Assam teas. Tea leaves are oxidized. How would you categorize oolong tea? Oolong tea leaves are only partially oxidized.</p>

		<div id="box2">
			<h2 id="box2">Green Tea</h2>
			<p>Something fascinating about green tea. Jasmine green tea is especially good. Tea leaves are not oxidized. Don't brew it too long or it gets bitter.</p>
			</div></div>

		<div id="box3">
			<h2 id="box3">White Tea</h2>
			<p>Something intriguing about white tea. I don't know enough about white tea, but it's supposed to have the least caffeine and a more delicate taste.</p>
